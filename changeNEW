This can be activated in the "date and time" settings.

{"Heizung hat in Sommerbetrieb gewechselt ☀️", "Heating has changed to summer mode ☀️"}
{"Heizung hat in Winterbetrieb gewechselt ❄️", "Heating has changed to winter mode ❄️"}
{"Heizkreis 2 hat in Sommerbetrieb gewechselt ☀️","Heating Circuit 2 has changed to summer mode ☀️"}
{"Heizkreis 2 hat in Winterbetrieb gewechselt ❄️","Heating Circuit 2 has changed to winter mode ❄️"}
{"Heizung hat in Frostmodus gewechselt ❄️", "Heating has changed to frost mode ❄️"}
{"Heizkreis 2 hat in Frostmodus gewechselt ❄️", "Heating Circuit 2 has changed to frost mode ❄️"}
{"Heizung hat den Frostmodus verlassen ❄️", "Heating has exited frost mode ❄️"}
{"Heizkreis 2 hat den Frostmodus verlassen ❄️", "Heating Circuit 2 has exited frost mode ❄️"}
