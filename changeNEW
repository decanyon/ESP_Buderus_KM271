# v4.1.0

## what's new

with this version comes the first implementation of mqtt discovery for Home Assistant ðŸŽ‰

Unfortunately I have to do some breaking changes!


### Home Assistant mqtt auto Discovery

MQTT discovery for Home Assistant makes it easy to get all values in Home Assistant.
The Logamatic values will automatically visible as mqtt device in Home Assistant.
The config values and the status values are displayed. Some config values can also be changed as in the WebUI.
This is the first implementation, therefore lets see this an experimental state.
I am open for feedback and further improvements. Please use the issues and discussion section.

### BREAING CHANGES!!!

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> In the past, there were separate mqtt topics defined for the setvalues of the logamatic config values.
These topics were similar to the config Topics itself, but unfortunately there were some differences.
Now the setvalue topics are the same as the config topics.

some examples:
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_tag_soll", "/setvalue/hc1_day_setpoint"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Tagtemperatur", "/setvalue/hc1_day_temp"}
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_frost_ab", "/setvalue/hc1_frost_mode_threshold"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Frost_ab", "/setvalue/hc1_frost_protection_threshold"}
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_ferien_tage", "/setvalue/hc1_holidays"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Ferien_Tage", "/setvalue/hc1_holiday_days"}

To be more compatible, it is possible to use upper and lower case letters in the german setvalue topics.
It is also now possible to use the "string options" instead of num values as this is necessary for the home assistant integration. 

example:

- hc_operation_mode - payload: "day", "night", "auto"
- hc1_reduction_mode - payload: "off", "fixed", "room", "outdoors"
- hc_program - payload: "custom", "family", "early", "late", "AM", "PM", "noon", "single", "senior"

## changelog

- fix value of HC1_SwitchOffOptimizationTime, HC2_SwitchOffOptimizationTime, HW_SwitchOffOptimizationTime (was not set before)
- If there is a whitespace in optional sensor name, it will be replaced in the responding mqtt topic
- Fixes the saving of the hostname. This was previously saved incorrectly as wifi.ssid which made the WiFi settings unusable. #98
