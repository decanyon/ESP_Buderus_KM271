### direct GitHub Update ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This update introduces an exciting new feature: You can now update to the latest version directly from GitHub in the WebUI â€“ no need to download the .bin file manually anymore!

Simply click on the version info in the bottom left corner, and a dialog will open. If a new version is available, you can initiate the update right there. It will automatically download and install the latest release from GitHub.

### encrypted Passwords

Passwords are now better protected and stored in encrypted form in the config.json
When updating, the existing passwords are automatically encrypted and saved again.

> [!CAUTION]
> As the passwords are stored in encrypted form after this update, it is no longer possible to switch to an older version without re-entering the passwords after the downgrade
